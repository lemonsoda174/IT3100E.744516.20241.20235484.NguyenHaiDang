1, When should accessor methods be used?

Since accessor methods expose information about how a class is implemented and is thus harder to maintain (due to issues related to design complexity, undesired provision of access to implementation details, data privacy, etc.), it is advisable to avoid accessor methods as much as possible.

It is highly recommended that an accessor method should only be used when we really need to access its attributes.

An alternative could be to implement Cunningham’s CRC card approach


2, If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Java does allow you to create multiple constructors in a class, which is known as constructor overloading. You can define multiple constructors with different parameter lists, allowing you to initialize objects in various ways.
