Alternatively, to compare items in the cart, instead of using Comparator, we can use the Comparable interface and override the compareTo()method. You can refer to the Java docs to see the information of this interface. 
Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach.
-	What class should implement the Comparable interface?
-	In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
-	Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
-	Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?

Answer:
1. The Media class should implement the Comparable interface
2. We compare by title, then cost, by adding the compareTo() method to the Media class
Sample code:
public int compareTo(Media other) {
    int titleComparison = this.getTitle().compareTo(other.getTitle());
    if (titleComparison != 0) {
        return titleComparison;
    } else {
        return Double.compare(this.getCost(), other.getCost());
    }
}
3. No, since the Comparable interface should only assume only one sorting method
4. We override the compareTo method in the Disc class by adding:
@Override
public int compareTo(Media other) {
    if (other instanceof Disc) {
        Disc otherDVD = (Disc) other;
        int titleComparison = this.getTitle().compareTo(otherDVD.getTitle());
        if (titleComparison != 0) {
            // Compare by title
            return titleComparison;
        } else {
            // Compare by decreasing length
            int lengthComparison = Integer.compare(otherDVD.getLength(), this.getLength());
            if (lengthComparison != 0) {
                return lengthComparison;
            } else {
                // Compare by cost
                return Double.compare(this.getCost(), otherDVD.getCost());
            }
        }
    } else {
        // If the media object is not a Disc, use the previously created method of the Media class
        return super.compareTo(other);
    }
}
